Introduction To Devops:

SDLC : It is a process to build package software or application.
 SDLC have two models:
1. waterfall model
Requirement Gathering & Analyis
Design
Implement
Test
Deploy
Maintenance

Disadvantages:
1.It is not suitable for complex projects where the changes are in high frequency.
2.Time consuming
3.Until an analys we complete of the current stage.we can't go for next stage and at the same time.we can't go back.
 In order to address these issues we have a next model is Agile methodology

Limitations of Agile methodology:
Devops team want's to change
Operation team want's stability
Devops--->Development+Operation

Development without Devops culture:
1.Release and deploy mismatches
2.Unpredectable issues
3.Blame game
4.Lack of monitoring

Development with Devops culture:
1.Streamlined delevories.
2.Team work in collaboration
3.Continous monitoring and feedback.

What need be done?
Use system with little or no working time.
use system with updated code

What exactly is devops in real life :


what devops is not?
1.Devops is not role , person or organization
2.Devops is not a separate team.
3.Devops is not aproduct or tool.
4.Devops is not about just writing the scripts or implementing tools.

What is devops:
Devops is a practise that allows a single team to manage the entire development life cycle .That is development, Testing ,Deployment &monitoring(Code--->Production)

What does Devops:
 
Integrate developers and operation team.
Improves collaboration an productivity by:-
Automating infrastructures
Automating the workflows
Continuously measuring application perform

Skills of a Devops Engineer:
1.Tools:
Version control system
Continuous Integration-->Jenkins
 Containerization/virtualization--->Docker
Configuration management--->Prometheus/Grafana

2.Networking Skills:
General Networking skills--->Establish connection between the containers/container orchestration

3.Other Skills:
People skill
process skill
customer skill and empathy
cloud awareness

Devops Life cycle :

1.Plan:
First stage of devops cycle where you can plan, track, visualize and summarize your project before working/starting it.
Ex: Jira,Trello,Tricenties

2.Code:
Second stage of devops cycle where the developers write their code.
Ex :Github,GitLab,Bigbucket.

3.Build:
Build is a prerelease version and is defined by build number, rather than by release number.
Ex: Apache maven

4.Test:
Process of executing automated test as a part of the software delivery pipeline , In order to obtain feedback on the business risks associated with a software release as rapidly as possible.
Ex: Jmeter, Selenium , Junit

5.Release:
This phase helps to integrate code into a shared repository using which you can detect and locate errors quickly and easily.
Ex: Bamboo,Gitlab

6.Deploy:
Manage and maintain development and deployment of software system and servers in any computational environment.
EX:AWS, Ansible, Chef

7.Operations:
This phase is to keep the system upgraded with latest update.
Ex: Aws, Ansible, Chef


8.Monitor:
It ensures that application is performing as desired and environment is stable.It quickly determines when a service is unavailable and understanding the underlying cause.
Ex: Prometheus,grafana,splunk, sensu,nagios.  

Why we need git:

1.Collaboration
2.Storing Versions
3.Figuring out what Happend
4.Back up

Issues without version control
1.Once saved , All the changes made in the files are permanent and can't be reverted back
2.No record of what was done and by whom.
3.Downtime that can occur because of a faulty update could cost millions in losses.
 
What is version control :
 Version control is system that documents changes made to a file or a set of files. It allows multiple users to manage multiple revisions of the same unit of information. It is snapshot of your project overtime.

Version control Tytpes :
Local version Control(LVC):
1.The practice of having the version  database in the local computer.
2.Local database keeps a record of changes made to files in version database.

Local Version Control : Issue
1.Issue: Multiple people paralelly working on the same project
2.Solution:
