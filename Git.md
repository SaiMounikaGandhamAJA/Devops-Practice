## `Why do we need Version Control?`
  * For collaboration
  * Storing Versions
  * Figuring out what happend
  * Backup

  ## `Issues without version control `
  * Once saved, all the changes made in the files are permanent and cannot be reverted back
  * No record of what was done and by whom
  * Downtime that can occur because of a faulty update could cost millions in losses 

  ## `Version Control :`
Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help track changes to files and manage versions over time. They are essential in software development and other fields where collaboration and revision history are crucial.
 *  Here are the types of version control systems:

    * Local Version Control Systems

    * Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

    * Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

## `Local Version Control Systems:`
 ### Description: 
Tracks file changes on a single computer. These systems are simple and store revisions locally.
## `How It Works: `
Changes are saved in a database or directory structure on the same machine.
## `Examples:`
Revision Control System (RCS)
Local backup scripts
 ## `Advantages:`
Simple and easy to set up.
Suitable for individuals.
 ## `Disadvantages:`
No collaboration features.
No remote backups (loss of data if the machine fails).

## `Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):`
`Description:` A single central server stores all the versioned files, and clients check out files from this server.

`How It Works:` Developers sync with a central server for commits, updates, and history.

`Examples:`
* Subversion (SVN)
 * Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
 * Perforce

`Advantages:`
* Easy to manage with a central repository.
* Simpler to enforce security and permissions.

`Disadvantages:`
 * Single point of failure (if the server crashes, all work stops).
* Limited offline capabilities.

 ## `Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):`
`Description:` Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.

`How It Works:` Changes are committed locally and then pushed/pulled to/from other repositories when needed.

`Examples:`
 * Git
 * Mercurial
 * Bazaar
 * Fossil

`Advantages:`
 * Full repository backups are available on every developer's machine.
 * Enables offline work.
 * Faster operations since most actions are local.
 * Decentralized collaboration reduces risks.

`Disadvantages:`
 * Initial learning curve for new users.
 * Larger storage requirements (complete history on every machine).
  
## `What is Git ?`
  Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfacing with each others changes.
  
  * It tracks changes in the source code during software development , allowing developers to revert to previous states, track changes and collaborate effectively .

  ### `History of GIT :`
  1973 : SCCM (Source Code Control System) 1 file
         RCM (Revision Control System) n files , 1 directory
         CVS (Concurrent Versions System) n files , n directories , 1 user
  
  2000 : SVN (Sub Version ) n files , n directories , n users

  2005 : GIT (Global Information Tracker)
  ### `Advantages of Git :`
  * It is Platform Independent
  * Free & Open Source 
  * ` Distributed Nature :` Every developers has a full copy of the entire repository , including the entire history of all the changes 
  * `Performance :` Git is designed to be fast , handling large projects effectively .

  ### `Understand GIT :`
  **Scenario :** Developing a website
  
  **1 . Start a Project :** Avinash and Anudeep are working together to develop a new website 
  
  2 . **Initial Setup :** Avinash creates the project's initial files and uses git to track these changes .
  
  3 . **Concurrent Work :** Anudeep adds a new feature while avinash fixes a bug , both using separate branches

  4 . **Merge Changes :** They merge their changes back into the main branch without losing each other's work

  5 . **History tracking and Revert :** They can revert to previous versions if any new changes introduce issues.

  ### `Commands :`
  * **which git :** It shows the whether the git is present or not
  * **yum install git :** To install git
  * **git init :** to initalize the git
  * **git --version :** it gives the version of the git
  * **git config --global user.name "Mouni" :** to change username or to give username
  * **git config --global user.email "mounika@gmail.com" :** to change email id or to give email id
  * **git config --global core.editor "vim" :** It takes vim editor defaultly to edit / modify the data in files
  * **git config --global help.autocorrect 1 :** It is set to auto correct
  * **git config --list :** It displays the what we have config
  * **git config --global --edit :** It edit / modify the configuring data 
             
      * all this config information is stored in git config in root user

## `Git Terminology :` 
### **Repository :** 
A Repository is a storage location where your project's code , files and history are kept
 * Repository can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a service like github)

## **Local Repository :** 
 * **Description :** A Local Repository is stored on your local machine .
   
   * It contains the project's files and the complete history of all changes .
* **Usage:** Used for development and testing before changes are shared with others

## **Central Repository:**
* **Description :** A Central Repository is a designated repository that serves as the main hub for collaboration.
  
  * It is authoritative source of truth for the project , where all the changes are eventually integrated.
* **Usage:** Typically used in centralized work flows where developers push their changes to  and pull updates frommthis central point.

## **Remote Repository:**
* **Description :** A Remote Repository is any repository that is not on your local machine .
  * It can be central repository or any other repository that you interact with over a network.

**Clone:**
    Cloning a repository means making a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.
    
  * This allows you to work on the project locally,make changes and later synchronize those changes back to the remote repository.

  **add :**  adding files means staging them for the next commit.

  * This tells git which files you want to include in your next snapshot of the repository.
  * The command git add <file> or git add . (to add all files) is used for this.

  **Commit:** Commiting is saving a snapshot your staged changes to the repository's history.

  * This creates a new revision of the project,which includes all the changes you;ve added.

  **Push:** Pushing means sending your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.

  * This updates the remote repository with your latest commits,allowing others to access your changes.  
### `Git Stages :`
 ![preview](Images/stages.PNG)
 
 **Commands:**

*  **git log :** It displays the information about the history of commits
* **git log --oneline:** It displays the information about the history of commands and give first seven characters in the commit id
* **git show e718265 :** It displays the information about the specific commit.
* **git diff a6745bd..e71ca59 :** It displays the difference between those two commits
* **git log --oneline --author:** It displays the information about commits of specific developer 
* **git ignore :** It ignores the formats of the file.
    
      touch .gitignore : We need to store the data of extensions that what we need to ignore in this file 
* **git remote add origin https://github.com username/repository-name.git (add the github repository as a remote)**
 
  * **git remote:** This is the git command used to manage remote connections.

  * Remotes are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or another network 

   * **add:** The add keyword is used to add a new remote connection to your local git repository
   * **Origin:** origin is a conventionally used name for the primary remote repository . you can name it anything , but origin is the default name most developers use.

 * **git push -u origin master:** to push the files from local repository to github

 When we clone the very first time an empty repository,we will be having 2 folders
    1. .git
    2. readme

 `Generate a token :`
 Settings - developer settings - tokens(classic) - generate new token - generate new token (classic) - Select first five packages or all - click on generte token

 ## `Branches :`  
  Branches help you manage different versions of your project and work on multiple developments simultaneously without affecting the main or other branches

  * **git branch :**  It displays the list of branches which we have
  * **git branch branch_name :** It creates the new branch
  * **git checkout branch_name (or) git switch branch_name :** to switch the branch
  * **git checkout -b branch_name :** to switch and create the branch
  * **git branch -d branch_name :** to delete the branch in local repository
  * **git push origin --delete branch_name :** it will delete the branch in remote repository after deleting in local repository
  
  **How can we rename a branch name ?** 
  Go for the settings inside a repository and scroll down there we can have an option called Default branch , there we can change our branch name

## `Merge :` 
Join two or more development histories together .
   
  A --- B --- C (test branch)
   
   |
   
   D --- E --- F --- G (Master branch) 

**Difference between clone and pull :**

* Purpose :

   * Clone : Creates a copy of the entire repository locally 

   * Pull   : Updates an existing local repository

* When used :

   * Clone : When starting to work on a repository for the first time
   * Pull : to sync changes from the remote repository

* Scope :

   * Clone : Copies all branches, files and commit history
   * Pull : updates only the current branch 

* Effect : 

   * Clone : Creates a new directory and initializes a new local repository
   * Pull : Merge all the changes into the current repository

* Example :

   * Clone : git clone <url>
   * Pull : git pull origin main


## **Fetch :** 
 Downloads changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch. It updates your local tracking branches .

 ## **What is git stash ?**
  Git stash is a command that allows you to temporarily save changes in your working directory without committing them .

* It essentially "stashes" your uncommitted changes away , allowing you to switch branches or perform other tasks without losing your work. Later , you can "unstash" these changes and continue working .
* **git stash :** Save your local modifications (staging and working directory ) to a new stash
* **git stash list :** View the list of stashed changes
* **git stash pop :** Apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list
* **git stash apply :** apply the most recent stash to working directory without removing it from stash list
* **git stash apply {n} :** apply the specific stash from stash list
* **git stash clear :** remove all stashes from the stash list

## **What is github ? and how it defers from git ?**
 Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history . Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage git repositories

 ## **What is fork ?**
 In github, a fork is a copy of repository that allows users to move changes without affecting the original project.

 **git rm --cached <file name> :** This command is used to remove files from the staging area without deleting them from the working directory
 **git rm --force <filename> :** This command is used to forcibly remove files from both the staging area and working directory
 **git commit -am "msg" :** It ommits and add the files at a time (existed files only)
 **git clone -b branch_name "url" :** to clone from specific branch
 **git push origin --set-upstream origin test :** to push after creation of branch

 ## `git restore :` 
 restore specified paths in the working tree with some contents from a restore source. If a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source , it will be removed to match the source
  
  * **Syntax :**  git restore --staged file-name

## `git revert :`
  to come back from the local repository to staging area

   * **Syntax:** git revert commit-id
             
        (or)

        git revert commitid commitid

  ## `Pull requests :`
  When merging pull requests you can allow any combination of merge commits , squashing or rebasing . At least one option must be enabled . If you have linear history enabled on any protected branch , you must enable squashing or rebasing .

  **Changing a commit message (Amend):** 
  If a commit message contains unclear , incorrect or sensitive information , you can ammend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to github . You can also change a commit msg to add missing information .

  * **Syntax:** git commit --amend -m "new msg"
